Object Detection Framework (ODF)
================================

ODF is a C++ framework created around OpenCV that simplifies object detection
and batch image processing.

COMPILING
---------
To compile the ODF library, create a build dir, and in the build dir call:
    cmake /path/to/odf

Then execute one or more of the following commands:
    # to build ODF as shared library
    make

    # to build ODF as static library
    make odf-static

    # to build example applications
    make samples

More details can be found in the INSTALL file.
